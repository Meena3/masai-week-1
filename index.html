                <p style="font:45;font-style:italic"><b>Development</b>
                        In 1995, Shueisha released Karakuri, a one-shot manga by <b>Masashi Kishimoto</b> that earned an honorable mention in the <b>Hop Step Award in 1996</b>. Kishimoto was unsatisfied with his subsequent drafts for a follow up, and decided to work on another project.[3] The new project was originally going to feature Naruto as a<u> chef</u>, but this version never made it to <u>print</u>. Kishimoto originally wanted to make Naruto a child who could transform into a fox, so he created a one-shot of Naruto for the summer 1997 issue of Akamaru Jump based on the idea.[4][5] Despite the positive feedback it received in a readers' poll, Kishimoto was unhappy with the art and the story, so he rewrote it as a story about ninjas.[6]
                        
                        The first eight chapters of Naruto were planned before it appeared in Weekly ,<b>Shōnen Jump</b>, and these chapters originally devoted many panels of intricate art to illustrating the Konoha village. By the time Naruto debuted, the background art was sparse, instead emphasizing the characters.[6] Though Kishimoto had concerns that chakra (the energy source used by the ninjas in Naruto) made the series too Japanese, he still believed it is an enjoyable read.[7] Kishimoto is a fan of <b>Godzilla</b>, and the tailed beasts mythology was introduced because Kishimoto wanted an excuse to draw monsters.[8] He has said that the central theme in Part I of Naruto is how people accept each other, citing Naruto's development across the series as an example.[9]
                        
                        For Part II of the manga, Kishimoto tried to keep the panel layouts and the plot easy for the reader to follow, and avoid "overdo[ing] the typical manga style".[10] He considers that his drawing style has changed from "the classic manga look to something a bit more realistic."[10] Because of wishing to end the arc involving Sasuke Uchiha search for his brother, Itachi, in a single volume, Kishimoto decided that volume 43 should include more chapters than regular volumes. As a result, Kishimoto apologized to readers for this since volume 43 was more expensive than regular volumes.[11]</p>
                        <p style="font-size:20px;color:red"><b>Characters</b></p>
                        <p style="font:45;font-style:italic">When he created <b>Naruto, Kishimoto</b> looked to other shōnen manga as influences for his work and tried to make his<b> characters unique</b>, while basing the story on <b>Japanese culture</b>.[12] The separation of the characters into different teams was intended to give each group a particular flavor. Kishimoto wanted each member to have a high level of aptitude in one skill and be talentless in another.[13] He found it difficult to write about <b>romance</b>, but emphasized it more in Part II of the manga, beginning with volume 28.[9] He introduced <b>villains</b> into the story to have them act as a counterpoint to his characters' moral values and clearly illustrate their differences.[14] As a result of how the younger characters were significantly <b>weaker</b> than the villains, Kishimoto made the ellipsis in order to have them age and become stronger during this time.[15]</p>
                        <p style="font-size:20px;color:red"><b>Setting</b>
                        <p stlye="font:45;font-style:italic">Kishimoto made use of the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_astrology">Chinese zodiac</a> tradition, which had a long-standing presence in Japan; the zodiac hand signs originate from this.[7] When Kishimoto was creating the primary setting of the Naruto manga, he concentrated initially on the designs for the village of Konoha. The idea of the setting came to him "pretty spontaneously without much thought," but admits that the scenery became based on his home in the Japanese prefecture of Okayama prefecture. Since the storyline does not specify when it is set, he was able to include modern elements in the series such as convenience stores.[16] He considered including automobiles, planes and simple computers, but excluded projectile weapons and vehicles from the plot.</p>
                    <p style="font-size:20px;color:red"><b>Conclusion</b></p>
                    <p style="font:45px;font-style:italic">When serialization began, Kishimoto decided the ending would feature a fight between two characters: Naruto and Sasuke,[18] That villain Nagato, also known as Pain, and the arc that was the important according to Kishimoto was the Pain Invasion Arc. This arc paved the way for the ending of Naruto to occur. Having Naruto fight a villain that he could not answer to about war until Naruto has experienced it for himself was the only way to go. And so, Nagato or Pain had Naruto experience having lost his mentor Jiraiya and being unable to forgive an enemy as Naruto always has done in the past. It was a developing point for Naruto as he finally could not answer something he had never experienced, and that was war. Kishimoto knew from then on that he would have to create the Fourth Great Shinobi War so Naruto could experience it and end the series after the end of the war.[1</p>
                    <p style="font:45px;font-style:italic">These events end with Naruto forgiving Sasuke as he had forgiven Nagato. Kishimoto chose Hinata Hyuga as Naruto's romantic partner from the early stages of the manga, since Hinata had always respected and admired Naruto even before the series' beginning, and Kishimoto felt this meant the two of them could build a relationship. This decision annoyed his wife because she wanted Naruto to marry Sakura Haruno,[19] but Kishimoto viewed Sakura as Naruto's friend and teammate, rather than a future wife. When Hinata first appeared, Kishimoto thought of forming a<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_triangle">love triangle </a>aamong the three characters, but because he decided that fighting was the main focus of the manga, there was little room for romantic plotlines.[20][21] By August 2009, Kishimoto had already planned the series' following chapters and how it would conclude, stating he had yet needed the energy to finish the series.[22] This caused concerns within readers who feared the manga would end shortly after Naruto and Nagato's confrontation. However, Kishimoto clarified shortly afterwards that the length would be bigger.[23] </p>
